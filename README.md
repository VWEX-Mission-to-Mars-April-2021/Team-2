## Retrospective Day 1

Could improve on:
- More frequent communication
- Planning of code, yet also explain clearly (ie. with comments)
- Ensuring people are assigned tasks and are ontrack

## Retrospective Day 2

Improved on:
- Communication between ourselves
- Efficiency of working on tasks

Could improve on:
- Proof-reading the code more often to find errors
- Commenting more oftenly
- Using time more wisely (wait less on testing)

## Retrospective Final Day

Improved on:
- Organisation of completing tasks
- Assigning peoples' roles
- Code running as expected

The mission could've been better if:
- There were more rovers to test on
- We had specified break times
